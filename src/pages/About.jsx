    <h4>Junior Web Developer</h4>
    <div className="info-content-wrapper">
      <p>With a strong background in interior design and 3D animation, I bring a unique perspective to web development. My previous experience has given me a deep understanding of user-centric design and I incorporate this into everything I do. I love untangling the brief and solving the puzzles of the design. I am passionate about learning and enjoy crafting intuitive and visually appealing web solutions.</p>
